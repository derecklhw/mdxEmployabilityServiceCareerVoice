What is employability?,"Employability refers to your ability to gain initial employment, maintain employment, and obtain new employment if required. In simple terms, employability is about being capable of getting and keeping fulfilling work. Your employability depends on your knowledge (what you know), skills (what you do with what you know) and attitudes (how you approach things) the way you use your knowledge and skills and present them to employers, and the context (e.g. personal circumstances and labour market environment) within which you seek work."

Employers are increasingly looking for students who are able to combine excellent academic achievement with practical hands-on experience."
